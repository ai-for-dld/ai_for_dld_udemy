## About the Course

The "AI for Digital Logic Design" Udemy course explores the fascinating intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Logic Design. It teaches how AI techniques can be leveraged to assist in the design, verification, and optimization of digital circuits using Verilog and VHDL. This repository serves as a practical companion to the course, providing all the code examples and interactive notebooks discussed throughout the lectures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to mirror the progression of the course, making it easy to find relevant files:

## Getting Started

To effectively use the contents of this repository, you will need the following:

### Prerequisites

* **For Colab Notebooks:** A Google account to access Google Colaboratory. No local installation is required.
* **For HDL Code:**
    * A Verilog/VHDL simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog, GHDL, ModelSim, Vivado, Quartus).
    * A text editor or IDE for writing/viewing HDL code.

### Running Colab Notebooks

1.  Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2.  Click on any `.ipynb` file. This will automatically open the notebook in Google Colaboratory in your browser.
3.  You can then run the cells directly within Colab.

### Simulating HDL Code

1.  Navigate to the relevant `hdl/verilog/` or `hdl/vhdl/` subdirectory for the module you are interested in.
2.  Open the desired `.v` (Verilog) or `.vhd` (VHDL) file in your preferred text editor or IDE.
3.  Use your chosen HDL simulator to compile and simulate the code. For example, using Icarus Verilog:

    ```bash
    iverilog -o my_design my_design.v my_design_tb.v
    vvp my_design
    ```

    Or with GHDL for VHDL:

    ```bash
    ghdl -a my_design.vhd my_design_tb.vhd
    ghdl -e my_design_tb
    ghdl -r my_design_tb --wave=my_design_tb.ghw
    ```

    *Refer to your simulator's documentation for specific commands and usage.*

## Contents

### HDL Examples

The `hdl/` directory is rich with practical examples covering various digital logic concepts, from basic gates to more complex sequential circuits. Each example is designed to illustrate the concepts taught in the course.

### Colab Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains interactive Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks integrate AI-powered tools and techniques to:

* Generate HDL code snippets.
* Assist in testbench creation.
* Perform automated design verification.
* Explore design space optimization.
* Visualize simulation results.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to add new examples or notebooks, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Please ensure your contributions adhere to the following guidelines:

* Follow the existing directory structure.
* Ensure HDL code is well-commented and syntactically correct.
* Ensure Colab notebooks are runnable and clearly explained.

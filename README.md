Take a simple synthesized design from Week 3.4 (e.g., and_gate_synth.v or a small counter). <br> 2. Run Yosys for FPGA bitstream generation:  ¬†¬†¬†¬† !yosys -p "read_verilog my_design.v; synth_ice40 -json my_design.json". (This synthesizes for iCE40 FPGAs). <br> 3. Run Nextpnr for Place & Route:  ¬†¬†¬†¬† !nextpnr-ice40 --json my_design.json --pcf my_design.pcf --asc my_design.asc --freq 25.

Add cross coverage to track combinations of coverpoints (e.g., A_is_zero_cross_B_is_max). <br> 4. Run: Simulate.  5. Observe: After simulation, SystemVerilog simulators (like commercial ones, or iverilog if it has very basic support) would report coverage percentage.

Hands-on (Simulated Problem): Create a Verilog module with two always blocks driven by separate, unsynchronized clocks. Try to pass a single bit of data from one domain to another without synchronization. <br> 3. Observe: In simulation, you'll see "X" propagation or incorrect data transfer.

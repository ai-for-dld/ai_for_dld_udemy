        "\n",
        "This chapter delves into the Register Transfer Level (RTL) implementation of fundamental sequential logic circuits using both Verilog and VHDL. Sequential circuits, unlike combinational circuits, have memory and their outputs depend not only on current inputs but also on past inputs (i.e., their current state). This memory element is typically realized using flip-flops.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each circuit, we will provide RTL code that incorporates standard clock and reset inputs, crucial for synchronous digital system design. The `%%writefile` magic command is used to directly save the code into files within a Jupyter (or Google Colab) environment, facilitating easy simulation and synthesis later.\n",

        "    Most circuits will be positive-edge triggered, meaning state updates occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n",
        "* **`rst`**: The reset signal is used to bring the circuit to a known initial state.\n",
        "    For simplicity, we will implement an **asynchronous active-high reset** in these examples.\n",
        "    This means when `rst` is high, the circuit immediately goes to its reset state, regardless of the clock.\n",

        "### Explanation of Verilog Script Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`echo \"--- Simulating ... ---\"`**: Provides clear headers for each simulation block.\n",
        "2.  **`VERILOG_MODULE_NAME=\"...\"`**: Defines a shell variable for the current module name, making it easy to reuse the script structure for different modules.\n",
        "3.  **`iverilog -o <output_executable> <rtl_file.v> <testbench_file.v> > <compile_log.log> 2>&1`**:\n",
        "    * `iverilog`: The Icarus Verilog compiler command.\n",
        "    * `-o <output_executable>`: Specifies the name of the executable file that will be generated after successful compilation.\n",
        "    * `<rtl_file.v> <testbench_file.v>`: The input Verilog source files. Both the design and its testbench are compiled together.\n",
        "    * `> <compile_log.log> 2>&1`: This redirects all standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) from the `iverilog` command into a file named `<compile_log.log>`. This is crucial for debugging compilation errors.\n",
        "4.  **`if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then ... else ... fi`**: This is a standard bash conditional statement.\n",
        "    * `$?`: This special shell variable holds the exit status of the *last executed command*. A value of `0` typically indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.\n",
        "    * This block checks if the `iverilog` command (compilation) was successful.\n",
        "5.  **`./<output_executable> > <sim_log.log> 2>&1`**:\n",
        "    * `./<output_executable>`: Executes the compiled simulation.\n",
        "    * The `testbench.v` contains `$dumpfile(\"wave.vcd\");` and `$dumpvars(0, <module_name>);` which automatically generate the `wave.vcd` file.\n",
        "    * `> <sim_log.log> 2>&1`: Redirects all standard output and standard error from the simulation run to a file named `<sim_log.log>`. This log will contain any `$display` messages from your testbench and runtime errors.\n",
        "6.  **Success/Failure Messages**: `echo` statements are used to inform the user about the outcome of each compilation and simulation step, including where to find detailed logs.\n",

        "1.  **`echo \"--- Simulating ... ---\"`**: Similar to Verilog, provides clear separation.\n",
        "2.  **`VHDL_ENTITY_NAME=\"...\"` and `VHDL_TESTBENCH_ENTITY_NAME=\"...\"`**: Defines shell variables for the RTL entity and its corresponding testbench entity. This is crucial as GHDL operates on entity names.\n",
        "3.  **`ghdl -a <rtl_file.vhdl> > <analyze_rtl_log.log> 2>&1`**:\n",
        "    * `ghdl -a`: This command analyzes (compiles) the VHDL source file. Each VHDL file is typically analyzed separately.\n",
        "    * The output and error are redirected to an analysis log specific to the RTL file.\n",
        "    * `COMPILE_STATUS_RTL=$?`: Stores the exit status for later checking.\n",
        "4.  **`ghdl -a <testbench_file.vhdl> > <analyze_tb_log.log> 2>&1`**:\n",
        "    * Analyzes the testbench VHDL file similarly.\n",
        "    * `COMPILE_STATUS_TB=$?`: Stores the exit status for the testbench analysis.\n",
        "5.  **`if [ ${COMPILE_STATUS_RTL} -eq 0 ] && [ ${COMPILE_STATUS_TB} -eq 0 ]; then ... else ... fi`**: Checks if *both* the RTL and testbench analysis steps were successful.\n",
        "6.  **`ghdl -e ${VHDL_TESTBENCH_ENTITY_NAME} > <elaborate_log.log> 2>&1`**:\n",
        "    * `ghdl -e`: This command elaborates the specified top-level entity (which should be your testbench entity). Elaboration links all analyzed design units and prepares the simulation model.\n",
        "    * Output and error are redirected to an elaboration log.\n",
        "    * `ELABORATE_STATUS=$?`: Stores the exit status of the elaboration.\n",
        "7.  **`ghdl -r ${VHDL_TESTBENCH_ENTITY_NAME} --wave=<filename.vcd> --stop-time=100ns > <sim_log.log> 2>&1`**:\n",
        "    * `ghdl -r`: Runs the simulation of the elaborated design.\n",
        "    * `--wave=<filename.vcd>`: Tells GHDL to dump waveform data into the specified VCD file. This creates the visual waveform for analysis. It's important to use a unique name for each module's VCD to avoid overwriting.\n",
        "    * `--stop-time=<time>`: (Optional but recommended) Specifies a maximum simulation time. This prevents runaway simulations if your testbench doesn't have a natural `$finish` or `wait;` condition.\n",
        "    * Output and error are redirected to a simulation log.\n",
        "    * `SIM_STATUS=$?`: Stores the exit status of the simulation run.\n",

        "After running these scripts, you will find `.log` files containing compilation and simulation outputs, and `.vcd` files for waveform viewing. These files can be downloaded from the Colab environment using the file browser on the left sidebar."

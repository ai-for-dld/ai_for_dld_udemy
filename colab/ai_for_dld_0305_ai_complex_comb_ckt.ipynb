        "In digital logic design, combinational circuits are foundational elements that produce outputs based solely on the current set of inputs ‚Äî without any memory or feedback. From basic gates like AND and OR, to moderately complex modules like adders and multiplexers, these circuits perform deterministic logic that is central to processors, encoders, data selectors, and arithmetic units.\n",

        "Traditionally, each component ‚Äî like a half adder or a multiplexer ‚Äî is coded, tested, and simulated separately.

This integration not only mirrors practical circuit design but also introduces learners to structured design approaches.\n",

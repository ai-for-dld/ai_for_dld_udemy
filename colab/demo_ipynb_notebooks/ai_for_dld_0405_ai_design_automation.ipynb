        "## Introduction\n",
        "In professional digital logic design, efficiency comes not only from knowing how to code a circuit, but also from building **reusable workflows** that adapt quickly to different projects. In this lecture, we will explore how to use **AI-generated prompts** along with **pre-built reusable scripts** for installation, simulation, waveform generation, and file packaging â€” all without rewriting the same setup for each project.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will focus on leveraging the `settings.tcl` configuration file and dynamic file lists to adapt these scripts to new circuits with minimal changes. This approach allows us to implement **complex combinational and sequential circuits** by changing only configuration parameters, not the underlying automation scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will learn:\n",
        "- How to write an AI prompt for generating both circuit and testbench.\n",
        "- How to integrate generated HDL code with reusable scripts.\n",
        "- How to configure `settings.tcl` to switch between Verilog and VHDL.\n",
        "- How to run the simulation and get results using the same scripts for every project.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you will be able to execute a **re-configurable AI-augmented design flow** entirely in Google Colab."

        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- Single simulation script works for all projects.\n",
        "- Easy to switch between Verilog and VHDL.\n",

        "\n",
        "This lecture introduces a critical shift in how we use AI to support HDL workflows: by building reusable assets. In all digital logic design projects—whether for learning, prototyping, or professional work—there are certain steps that get repeated across circuits. These include installing tools, running simulations, and downloading output files. Instead of manually repeating these steps in every notebook or project, we can automate them using script-based prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alongside scripts, we'll also explore the concept of prompt templates. These are AI prompts that follow a structure and can be reused to generate HDL code, testbenches, and simulation commands for different circuits by simply changing parameters like gate type or number of bits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this session, you'll not only write such reusable prompts but also understand why they're necessary, how they’re structured, and where they fit in your AI-augmented HDL journey.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this lecture, you’ll have a working set of shell scripts and AI prompts that can serve as your personal HDL automation toolkit.\n",

        "In HDL-based digital design, many steps are repeated again and again. For example, every time you start a new project, you need to install the required tools like GHDL, Icarus Verilog, and GTKWave. Similarly, after simulation, you always need to download the output files, such as `.vcd`, `.log`, or `.out`, to analyze the waveforms. These tasks can be automated using shell scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "But automation doesn't stop at scripting. With the help of AI tools like Gemini or ChatGPT, we can also generate the HDL code and testbenches through well-structured prompts. These prompts follow certain reusable patterns. If you describe the functionality, language, and design constraints clearly, the AI can produce code that works with minimal corrections. This makes your workflow faster and more scalable.\n",
